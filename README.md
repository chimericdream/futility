Futility
========

To see it in action (assuming rcssserver and rcssmonitor are installed):

1. Compile the code (this should happen automatically if you've got it in an eclipse project with the source directory as `src/java/` and the build directory as `build/`.)
2. `rcssserver`
3. `rcssmonitor`
4. `./manage.sh compete`
